# Mitigating Eviction Risk for Residents in the City of Dallas

This is a beta testing project of the [Solve for Good framework](https://solveforgood.org/), working with The City of Dallas and the Child Poverty Action Lab. 

The overall focus here is both the **impact of evictions** and **understanding which communities housing instability has disproportionate negative effects on**. Ideally (perhaps eventually), there is a wish to proactively intervene in order to help families before eviction occurs. Furthermore, the City of Dallas has a reserve of risk mitigating funds (CDBG/ESG) that can be used to help pay the rent of a tenant at-risk of being evicted.

## Goal

The project has a double goal:

* Minimize the number of people who are evicted from their homes 
* Maximize the number of people that can be assisted with eviction risk mitigating funds. 

<a name="analyses"></a>
## Other analyses of interest

*	Which neighborhoods have had the highest rates of eviction? Which apartment complexes?
*	In neighborhoods where eviction is the highest, what are the demographics (e.g., racial/ethnic breakdown, single-parent versus two-parent households, average household size, etc.)? How do each of these demographic variables relate to eviction/what's the relationship between each and eviction?
*	How does household income relate to eviction?
*	Is there a relationship between real estate transactions and evictions? What about construction/new development and evictions? 
*	How does eviction relate to student mobility? 
*	In neighborhoods with high rates of eviction, what is the breakdown of renters versus homeowners? What is the average rental price?
